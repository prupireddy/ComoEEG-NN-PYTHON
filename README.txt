Each program has its own readme in its metadata. This is branch stores the code for the neural network.  This branch
belongs to CNN V2. It works off of CNN_V1, the master. 

NN.py:
Input - you just need a directory with all of the ictal spectrogram images (stored in a stacked TIFF format) in one folder, seperated from all of the interictal images stored in another folder. 
There should be no other folders in that directory. If you work through all of the code in CNN_V2 MATLAB. You should be able to accomplish this. 
Output - None. The accuracy is outputted within the program. You can also output the summary of the network if you desire - the code of which is stored at the bottom of the page.


*The actual implemention should be pretty easy. Just change the patient number as you move to a different patient.
