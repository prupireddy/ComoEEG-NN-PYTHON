Each program has its own readme in its metadata. This is branch stores the code for the neural network. Process oriented & Paper-style notes are stored in the report in CNN + Spectrograms. This branch
belongs to CNN V3. 

NN.py:
Input - you just need a directory with all spectrograms, the state array, the shape array in a 
binary file format. They should be arranged with P(insert patient number)_(observation number)_(channel number).
If you work through all of the code in CNN_V2 MATLAB. You should be able to accomplish this. 
Output - None. The accuracy is outputted within the program. 
You can also output the summary of the network if you desire - the code of which is stored at the bottom of the page.
